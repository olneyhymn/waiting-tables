Since starting Waiting Tables, my wife had our first baby, I started a new job, and I took on some new responsibilities at our church. This hasn't left enough time in the week for me to continue doing the bi-weekly podcast. I hope and pray that people will continue to benefit from the [podcast archives](https://waiting-tables.com/episode/), and I hope to continue it in the future.

In the mean time, I'm going to start a mailing list about church operations, administration, and logistics. [Please sign up today](http://eepurl.com/cQtph5).
