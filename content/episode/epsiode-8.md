I talk with pastor and designer [Josh Byers](http://www.joshbyers.com) about his recent blog post [Church Video on a Budget of $1000](http://www.joshbyers.com/blog/2017/8/church-video-on-a-budget). Josh explains how to use a DSLR camera, a microphone, and basic lighting for recording "basic interviews, testimonies, life stories and other video productions your church may have."
