Matt Heermea is a Pastor of [Stonebrook Church](http://stonebrook.org/) in Ames, Iowa and owner, director and Web Strategist at [Mere Agency](https://mereagency.com/ "Mere Agency - Effective, easy-to-use, Web sites"). Prior to this, Matt was Principal Designer at AOL, working on such sites as [Engadget.com](https://www.engadget.com/), and later as the Sr. Web Manager for [DesiringGod.org](http://www.desiringgod.org/ "Desiring God").

Matt recently wrote an article called [Three Tips to Instantly Improve Your Church's Graphic Design](http://mattheerema.com/web-tech-design/2017/06/three-tips-to-instantly-improve-your-churchs-graphic-design/). I speak with Matt about that article.

Here were some of my takeaways:

* The reason we get cheesy, bad design is that people are given the tools [e.g. computers] without the principles of design.
* Even if you don't have formal training, if we do design mindfully, we can dramatically improve it.
* Thinking about our graphic design and our communication is a way to show we care about our ministry.

Go [read the post](http://mattheerema.com/web-tech-design/2017/06/three-tips-to-instantly-improve-your-churchs-graphic-design/) and listen to my interview with Matt!
